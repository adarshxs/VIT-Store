# CodeChef club interview

Created a sample E-Commerce website using React JS and Fake Store API as required by the interviewer(codechef club interview).

How to run:
'''
npm install
'''
'''
npm start
'''
tasks done:
1. design using a css framework(used bootstrap rather than tailwind).
2. create appropriate routings
3. add a sample.json file in the root that contains title, subtitle, price, etc(though I did not fully understand what was to be done here).
